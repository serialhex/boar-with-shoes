Repository format 0.1

This is a versioned repository of files. It is designed to be easy to
recover in case the original software is unavailable. This document
describes the layout of the repository, so that a programmer can
construct a simple program that recovers the data.

All files are stored verbatim in the "blobs" directory, named after
their md5 checksum, and sorted in sub directories based on the start
of their names. For instance, if a file "testimage.jpg" has the
checksum bc7b0fb8c2e096693acacbd6cb070f16, it will be stored in
blobs/bc/bc7b0fb8c2e096693acacbd6cb070f16 since the checksum starts
with the letters "bc". The filename "testimage.jpg" is discarded. The
information necessary to reconstruct a file tree is stored in a
session file.

The individual sessions are stored in the "sessions" sub
directory. Each session represents a point in time for a file
tree. The session directory contains two files, bloblist.json and
session.json. See RFC4627 for details on the json file format. For
each entry in the list of blobs, a filename and a md5 checksum is
stored. 

To restore a session, iterate over the bloblist and copy the blob with
the corresponding checksum to a file with the name specified in the
bloblist.
